SELECT current_scn FROM v$database;
SELECT DBMS_FLASHBACK.get_system_change_number FROM dual;
SELECT TIMESTAMP_TO_SCN(SYSTIMESTAMP) FROM dual;

That SCN is then used with the FLASHBACK_SCN parameter.
expdp ..... flashback_scn=5474280

The following queries may prove useful for converting between timestamps and SCNs.

SELECT TIMESTAMP_TO_SCN(SYSTIMESTAMP) FROM dual;
SELECT SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP(5474751) FROM dual;
