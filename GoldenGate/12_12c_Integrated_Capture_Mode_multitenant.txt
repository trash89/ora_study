GoldenGate Integrated Capture Mode
One of the new features in GoldenGate 11g is the Integrated Capture mode.

In the earlier classic capture mode, the Oracle GoldenGate Extract process captures data changes FROM the Oracle redo or archive log files on the source system.
In integrated capture mode, the Oracle GoldenGate Extract process interacts directly with the database log mining server which mines or reads the database redo log files
and captures the changes in the form of Logical Change Records (LCR’s) which are FROM there written to the GoldenGate trail files.

The basic difference is that in the Integrated Capture mode, the extract process does not directly read the redo log files. 
That part of the job is done by the logmining server residing in the Oracle database.

Integrated capture supports more data types as well as compressed data and as it is fully integrated with the database there is no additional setup steps 
required when we are configuring GoldenGate with things like RAC, ASM and TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)

In the integrated capture mode there are two deployment options:

a) Local deployment
b) Downstream deployment

Basically it depends on WHERE the log mining server is deployed.

In the Local deployment, the source database and the log mining server are the same database.

In downstream deployment, the source and log mining databases are different databases. 
The source database uses redo transport to ship the archived redo log files to the ‘downstream’ database WHERE the log mining server is residing. 
The log mining server extracts changes in the form of logical change records and these are then processed by GoldenGate and written to the trail files.

So in the downstream integrated capture mode, we offload any overhead associated with the capture or transformation FROM the source database 
to the downstream database which may be used only for GoldenGate processing and not for any production user connections.
